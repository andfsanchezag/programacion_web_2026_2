# Domain Model

## Introduction

The Domain Model represents the core business entities of the Banking Information Management System. These entities encapsulate the business rules, data, relationships, and lifecycle concepts described in the system specification.

The model follows Object-Oriented Design and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. Inheritance is used to represent genuine domain specialization, while explicit object relationships are preferred over generic identifier fields.

The model distinguishes between:

* **Persons**, which represent identifiable people and their role within the system.
* **Customers**, which represent people or organizations that have a banking relationship with the institution.
* **Users**, which represent system identities used for authentication and authorization.
* **Banking Products**, which represent financial products and banking services.
* **Operations**, which represent significant business actions performed on banking products or services.
* **Audit Logs**, which provide an immutable historical record of operations.

A banking product or service may generate multiple operations throughout its lifecycle. Every significant business operation must be recorded in the audit trail.

# Person (Abstract)

## Description

Represents any identifiable person within the banking system.

This abstract class centralizes the common identity and contact information shared by customers and system users.

The role assigned to a person represents what that person means within the system and determines the responsibilities or business capabilities associated with that person.

This class cannot be instantiated directly.

## Description

Represents a banking service that moves funds between two bank accounts.

Transfers are considered banking products or services because they represent a service offered by the institution and participate in the banking product lifecycle.

A transfer may require approval depending on the applicable business rules.

Every significant action in the transfer lifecycle generates an operation that must be recorded in the audit trail.

## Inherits From

`BankingProduct`

## Attributes

# Operation

## Description

Represents a significant business action executed over a banking product or service.

Operations provide traceability between users, banking products, and audit records.

A banking product may generate multiple operations during its lifecycle.

An operation represents an event or action that occurred; it is distinct from the current status of the affected product.

For example:

```text
BankAccount.accountStatus = BLOCKED
```

represents the current state of the account, while:

```text
Operation.operationType = ACCOUNT_BLOCKING
```

represents the action that caused the state change.

## Attributes

| Attribute       | Type           | Description                                           |

| affectedProduct | BankingProduct      | Banking product or service involved in the operation.        |
| details         | Map<String, Object> | Flexible document containing operation-specific information. |

## Business Rules

* Audit records are immutable.
* Audit records are append-only.
* An audit record cannot be deleted after persistence.
* Every significant business operation must produce an audit record.
* The `userRole` must represent the role applicable at the time the operation was performed.

# Domain Lifecycle Relationship

The general lifecycle of a banking product or service is:

```text
BankingProduct
      │
      │ significant business action
      ▼
  Operation
      │
      │ audit registration
      ▼
  AuditLog
```

For example, when a bank account is blocked:

```text
BankAccount
    │
    │ accountStatus changes
    ▼
BLOCKED
    │
    ├── Operation
    │      operationType = ACCOUNT_BLOCKING
    │      performedBy = User
    │
    └── AuditLog
           operationType = ACCOUNT_BLOCKING
           affectedProduct = BankAccount
           performedBy = User
           details = operation-specific information
```

Similarly, when a loan is approved:

```text
Loan
    │
    │ loanStatus changes
    ▼
APPROVED
    │
    ├── Operation
    │      operationType = LOAN_APPROVAL
    │      performedBy = User
    │
    └── AuditLog
           operationType = LOAN_APPROVAL
           affectedProduct = Loan
           performedBy = User
           details = operation-specific information
```

# Domain Value Objects

## Introduction

Value Objects represent immutable concepts within the banking domain.

Unlike entities, they do not have their own identity. They are defined by their values and encapsulate controlled business concepts.

Value Objects prevent primitive values and scattered string literals from being used throughout the domain.

| code        | String | Unique business identifier.                           |
| name        | String | Human-readable name displayed within the application. |
| description | String | Business definition of the catalog value.             |

## Characteristics

* Immutable.
* Equality is based on catalog values.
* Catalog values must be controlled by the domain.
* Catalog values must not be represented by arbitrary strings throughout the application.

# Domain Design Rules

## Person and User

* `User` inherits from `Person`.
* `role` is defined in `Person` and inherited by `Customer` and `User`.
* `User` must not duplicate the `role` attribute.
* `User.customer` is an explicit domain relationship and must not be represented through a generic identifier such as `relatedEntityId`.
* A `User` may exist without an associated `Customer` when representing an internal employee.

## Customer and User Status

* `CustomerStatus` represents the customer's banking relationship.
* `UserStatus` represents system access.
* These statuses are independent concepts even when they currently contain similar values.
* A change in customer status does not automatically imply a change in user status unless explicitly required by a business rule.

## Banking Products and Services

* `BankingProduct` represents both financial products and banking services.
* `BankAccount`, `Loan`, and `Transfer` are specializations of `BankingProduct`.
* `identifier` is the common identity attribute of all banking products and services.
* Attributes are inherited only when they represent the same business concept across the parent and child classes.
* Product-specific lifecycle states remain in their corresponding status value objects.

## Operations

* A banking product or service may generate multiple operations throughout its lifecycle.
* Significant business actions must generate an `Operation`.
* An operation references the affected `BankingProduct`.
* An operation references the `User` who performed the action.
* Product status represents the current state; operation represents an event or action that occurred.

## Audit Trail

* Every significant operation must be recorded in the `AuditLog`.
* Audit records are immutable.
* Audit records are append-only.
* Audit records must preserve the user role applicable when the operation was performed.
* Operation-specific information may be stored in the flexible `details` document.

## Value Objects

* Value Objects are immutable.
* Equality is determined by their values rather than object identity.
* Business entities reference Value Objects instead of primitive strings for controlled business concepts.
* Primitive enumerations are reserved for fixed technical concepts that do not require business metadata or behavior.
* This approach improves domain expressiveness, consistency, maintainability, and alignment with Domain-Driven Design principles.
